# Developing UI for tracking of items according to user order

## Objective

A factory makes mobile phones and sells those to the various customers, who are the distributers of OEMs, shops or even direct human customers. The factory wants to implement the information system that would allow  dynamically to place new orders, know the status of the production line, what orders there are at this moment, what is the remaining time to finish each order.  
the project should use broadly used and proven web standards and latest platforms that has the advantage of building scalable (easier to extend) systems that have a greater chance to serve for the longer time compared to what was there before.

## Implementation

The factory production line consists of 12 workstations - 11 robot stations and one manual work station. The simulator of the system having similar interface is located at the following URL:http://escop.rd.tut.fi:3000
The previous part of this project was implemented in the previous assignments namely:
 * Using different data formats to visualise machine health and states: https://github.com/palashTUT/Factory-Information-System-MOM.git
 * Create and query MySQL database for user order handling and also status of production: https://github.com/palashTUT/FIS-assignment-2.git
In this part we implemented UI combining all the previous implemented assignments.
